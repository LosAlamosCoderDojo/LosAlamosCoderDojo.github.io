<h1>Los Alamos Coder Dojo</h1>
<h3>A kids' coding club</h3>
<p>
We assist coders between 6th and 12th grade who are teaching
themselves computing skills through projects.
</p>
<p>
This website is hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/LosAlamosCoderDojo">GitHu</a>b.
We also have another website:
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ladojo/home">Los Alamos Coder Dojo
on Google Sites</a>.
</p>

<h2>When and Where</h2>
<iframe class="mapembed" width=350 height=225 frameborder="0" src="https://maps-api-ssl.google.com/maps?hl=en-US&ll=35.887684,-106.31512&output=embed&q=35.887855,-106.315754+Los+Alamos+Coder+Dojo%29&z=18"></iframe>

<p>
We meet Tuesdays from 6:00 pm to 7:00 at the Los Alamos Makerspace,
3540 Orange St., Suite LV1 (next to where PEEC used to be).
</p>
<p>
There's no entry fee, you don't need any coding experience to get started,
and you can earn colored USB wristbands by writing programs.
</p>
<p>
Come by and see what we're all about!
</p>

<h2>About Belts</h2>
<p>We award different colored USB flash drive wristbands based on your
achievements. We call them "belts", based on the martial arts
tradition of colored belts to denote rank. Belts provide a visual
cue about where participants are, and a sense of identity for
participants.</p>
<p>The
goal of the Dojo is not to get belts, though! We want you to feel
proud of the skills you worked hard to obtain: the belt is just a
<em>representation</em> of that. If you lose your orange belt,
you'll still remember how to hack a Raspberry Pi into an alarm
clock using the i2c bus and an ATMega 7-segment backpack, which is
<em>way cooler</em> than the belt.</p>
<p>
Getting belts in our Dojo is <em>hard</em>. You are going to have
to really work to get to the next level. There are no global
standards for belt levels, it's up to each Dojo. It's okay to have
feelings and opinions about how other Dojos award colors, but we
also expect you to be courteous about it toward other Dojos, and
keep the whining within our Dojo to a minimum.</p>
<h2>Belt Principles</h2>
<p>We have guiding principles about the belts, inspired by the main
<a href="https://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo site</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one has a right to a belt: it must be earned</li>
<li>We (the whole Dojo: mentors, parents, and all club members) will
help you get there</li>
<li>We will be clear about what is required to get to the next belt level</li>
<li>We will give you feedback for next time if you did not make it</li>
<li>An element of Social Good is a must (for example: mentoring others
in the Dojo, making a website for a charity, teaching elderly people
to use the Internet)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Belt Colors</h2>
<p>Our primary belt sequence consists of eight colors: white, yellow,
blue, green, orange, red, purple, and black.</p>
<p>We may introduce other colors of belt outside of this sequence. Any
time a new color is introduced, it will be available to all coders
forever for an equivalent achievement, and the requirements will be
added to this document.</p>
<p>
Belts must be obtained in order. As an example, you cannot get a
blue belt without first obtaining the yellow one.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Belt Reviews</h2>
<p>Belt reviews happen on the first Saturday of every month. They are
a meeting of mentors to determine if coders have met the requirements
to move on to the next color belt.</p>
<p>You must apply to be considered for a review. To apply, just tell a
mentor that you would like to be considered at the next meeting.
Mentors will provide guidance about how to prepare your project for
review. You can apply to as many meetings as you like, but you can
only submit one project per meeting unless you have special approval
from the mentors.</p>
<p>Belt review meetings should serve as milestones for your projects.
Your project needs to be fully completed, committed to a repository
(if appropriate), with build instructions and usage documentation,
before the belt review meeting starts. We will publish belt review
dates far enough ahead that you can plan out your project work with
belt review dates.</p>
